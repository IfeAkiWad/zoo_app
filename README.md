# Zoo App

Basic Web App for creating reports about animals at zoos by zookeepers. Our aim is to have the observations help wildlife experts understand how to create more natural environments for animals to live in. 

## Installation

Follow these easy steps to install and start the app:

### Set up Rails app

First, install the gems required by the application:

    bundle install

Next, execute the database migrations/schema setup:

	rake db:setup


### Start the app

Start the Rails app. 

     rails server

You can find your app now by pointing your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If everything worked you can sign up through Google or create your own Zookeeper account:

	User: demo@zoo.com
	Password: phrase

### Using ZooApp

As of yet the functioning is simple. Search by animals to see reports already submitted by fellow zookeepers, create a new report, and check to the health rating of the animals at the time of the report submission. 

## So, what next?

Zoo App will be transferred on to mobile interfaces after testing phase. If the app becomes invaluable in helping our friends living in zoos find happier and natural lives, this app will be fully developed. We do not like taking animal-life from natural habitats, and so are trying to find a middle ground, where human beings can see animals in a way that gives them freedom.
